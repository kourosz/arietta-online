**Low weight, high grip and stability**
Thanks to its natural rubber sole with integrated GRIP BARS, the new GEWO SMASH-FLEX guarantees excellent grip and perfect traction for your footwork in all directions.
The torsion system in the midfoot area supports your speed strength. The super-light LONGLAST-PU upper with its many VENTILATION SPOTS provides for optimum breathability. The STABLE OVERLAYS stabilize your foot even in the quickest moves and side steps.
GEWO SMASH FLEX is a state-of-the-art competition shoe offering ultimate wear comfort. The EVA midsole guarantees optimum shock absorption for indoors sports, and the HONEYCOMB INSOLE adjusts to your feet perfectly. We placed great emphasis on small but precious details like, for example, the reinforced eyelets for firm lacing. The integrated LACE STRAP will keep the lacing in place even in the toughest matches.
