**Player type / features:**
- Made for next-level speed and spin
- Linear and reliable coupling of the ball and perfect energy transfer.
- Power, Spin and feeling for table tennis brought to perfection.

**Maximum Power Play**

Due to permanent product adjustments, e.g. the introduction of the new ABS balls, rubbers had to be adjusted accordingly to these trends. The latest ball generation produces less rotation and speed. To compensate for this loss in rotation and speed, you have two options: Adjust your technique or your material. GEWO aims at supporting the necessary physical adjustments with innovative solution approaches: A thin, high-grip top sheet (nexxTT) compensating the loss in speed and rotation with its inherent dynamics and higher tension (N.E.P.). Plus, a medium-pore, dynamic sponge which, depending on the performance variant chosen (XT -> speed; EL -> spin), makes the Nexxus Pro Series a real Energy Monster, especially the maXXimum thickness ( 2,2mm/2,3 mm = Maxximum Power Play).

**DGC40+ 2.0**

One of the factors of success of the GEWO HYPE EL / XT / KR rubbers was the innovative DGC40+ top sheet technology. DGC40+ stands for constant, reliable coupling upon ball contact, and the grippy surface prevents slipping of the ball. The introduction of the latest ball generation (e.g. GEWO Select Pro 40+ ***), however, also calls for a further development and adaptation of the top sheets. The result: DGC40+ "Dynamic-Grip-Concept 2.0. The top sheet was specially developed for and adjusted to the requirements of the latest ball generations. If you dont go forward, you go backwards!

**FlexTech**

The flexible sponge/rubber design FLEX-TECH (XT) which was specially developed for GEWO, produces impressive speed. Rubbers from the XT series, combined with the DGC40+ 2.0 top sheet, transform the speed of your opponent's topspins into energy and release this energy again in your own stroke when the ball leaves your bat. The pimple heads in the rubber are arranged at a greater distance from one another, and they are slightly thinner than in EL rubbers. These rubbers primarily focus on speed.

**Elastic Rubber**

The EL rubber (Elastic Rubber), despite its compactness provides for great ball contact feedback and a unique feel. All rubbers of this series are made for spin. The pimple heads in the rubber are arranged at a smaller distance from one another, and they are slightly thicker than in XT rubbers. When it comes to generating spin, the DGC40+ 2.0 top sheet unfolds its true strength (highly reliable coupling and maximum spin), as it provides for a slightly larger contact area upon ball contact. Enjoy a new experience!
